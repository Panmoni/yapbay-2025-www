In fact, those options mean people have to hold their crypto and cheer for number-go-up. Otherwise, they are just losing money by entering crypto.\n\nWith regular inflows of crypto, people can be incentivized to stay in crypto and to spend crypto for everyday needs. To save in crypto. To do business in crypto.\n\nThis is how we get the next billion crypto users, and how we get them to see crypto as more than a game of betting to get the number to go up.\n\n## Why Remittances\n\nRemittances are a $700 billion industry where money must cross borders to be useful. This is precisely where cryptocurrency can be most useful right now, because fiat currency is meant to keep people pent up inside nation-state borders.\n\nCrypto sets them free.\n\nFurthermore, remittance fees and paperwork are prohibitively expensive across much of the globe. By building up liquidity and options, remittances can be cheaper and faster. We can use crypto first as a transport layer.\n\nLater, we can provide incentives for users to keep their remittances in crypto, and then spend it at merchants.\n\nThis is the beginning of a viable crypto-only economy.\n\n## Why the Developing World\n\nTradFi works worst of all in the developing world. Payment networks don't talk to each other. Regulations are high. Identification is unreliable. Capital formation is compromised.\n\nA great book on this topic is Hernando de Soto's _[The Mystery of Capital](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/86154)_.\n\nAll of this adds up to an enormous opportunity make assets liquid, release pent-up desire to form new capital and a unique opportunity to assist the 2 billion working people of the informal economy in creating amazing new prosperity for themselves, and for the rest of the world.\n\n## LocalBitcoins 2.0\n\nYap Bay is a kind of LocalBitcoins 2.0. Sure, it will have the same kind of P2P exchange functionality as LocalBitcoins, LocalCryptos, Paxful, etc.\n\nYap Bay is building ramps, sure. Ramps that don't include protocol-level KYC or AML. Ramps that are open to everyone, everywhere. Ramps that let individual traders decide whom they want to trade with and under what terms. Ramps that are censorship-resistant, decentralized and multi-lingual.\n\nBut it's much more than that.\n\n## TradFi-to-DeFi Lego Blocks\n\nYap Bay aims to create P2P fiat and crypto liquidity so that remittance senders can make remittances with fiat currency that trace a path through complex and fragmented TradFi payment networks, to get the money where it needs to go, using crypto as the transport layer.\n\nBy integrating fiat, we facilitate the entrance of crypto newbies who can use the currencies they are comfortable with.\n\nBy using crypto, we bridge disconnected fiat payment networks to get the funds where they need to go, faster and cheaper than current TradFi remittance options.\n\nIn this way, we will disrupt TradFi remittances, and give birth to sustainable crypto inflows which can shower thousands of local economies with crypto inflows, giving a needed boost to vibrant crypto economies.\n\n## Mission\n\nYap Bay is on a mission to facilitate access to cryptocurrency for people across the globe, without having to endure onerous KYC or the arbitrary limits and opaque reserves status of centralized exchanges (CEXs).\n\nWe are building the Yap Bay P2P crypto exchange so anyone, anywhere can have uncensorable, KYC-free, transparent and open-source fiat on- and off-ramps.\n\nWe see this as making a meaningful contribution towards the goal of facilitating access to prosperity for people across the globe who have been denied access to the full benefits of an accountable monetary system.\n\nTowards that end, we seek to work with individuals, teams, chains and anyone who is also excited about this mission.\n\n## Vision\n\nWe envision a world of universal prosperity, where every human being has the opportunity to realize their potential.\n\nWe envision a world where everyone, everywhere enjoys monetary freedom; and may use and create money as they see fit, trading it on a voluntary basis across borders, from anywhere to anywhere, from anyone to anyone.\n\nWe envision a world of crypto mass adoption, where everyone has access to prosperity, where no one is cut out of the system or left behind.\n\nWe envision a world free from large-scale oppressive forces such as nation-states and rent-seeking intermediaries such as banks, so that individuals can develop as they see fit, entering into voluntary relationships with each other by mutual agreement, without interference from those who would unjustly tilt the playing field in their own favor using aggressive institutions or unfair restrictions on our liberty.\n\n## Let's Connect\n\nWe encourage you to join us in the process of protocol design via our [litepaper GitHub repo](https://github.com/Panmoni/yapbay-litepaper), as there is still much to discuss, decide and define. We want and value your input.\n\n### Engage With Us\n\nIf the Yap Bay mission is exciting to you, please join us and contribute to the level that is convenient for you. We welcome the interest of coders, writers, marketers, idea people, thoughtful critics, salespeople, community leaders, prospective partners and more.

He can receive Larry's 50 USD in his US bank account and in return sells him 50 USDC.\n\nThis USDC is initially be escrowed by Mike.\n\nOnce Larry makes his fiat payment of 50 USD to Mike's bank account, Mike releases escrow.\n\nThe escrowed USDC is then transferred into escrow with Andres, the trader for Offer 2.\n\n**Offer 2**: Andres is based in Colombia. He can receive the 50 USDC and in return deposits 50 USD worth of COP (roughly 195,000 COP) to Maria's Colombian bank account.\n\nThis is basic use case of the YapBay platform.\n\n### Scenario 2: Global Freelance Payment\n\nNina is a freelance web designer based in Manila, Philippines. She just got a client from London, Mr. Smith who is seeking to send her payment for designing his business website.\n\nMr. Smith agrees to pay Nina 750 GBP, but experiences problems with his traditional financial institution citing high foreign transaction fees and lengthy processing times.\n\nHowever, he discovers YapBay as a more efficient alternative.\n\nHe connects two offers on YapBay.\n\n**Offer 1**: Paul, a UK crypto-enthusiast, can receive the 750 GBP in his UK bank account from Mr. Smith and he, in return, can sell Mr. Smith 750 GBP worth of USDC which will be escrowed.\n\n**Offer 2**: Grace based in the Philippines is looking to sell her 750 GBP worth of USDC received from Paul, in exchange for depositing the equivalent amount in PHP (approximately 50,000 PHP) to Nina’s bank account in the Philippines.\n\nThis way, YapBay has managed to provide an efficient and cost-effective global payment method for freelancers like Nina and her clients.\n\n### Scenario 3: Microloans for Small Businesses\n\nSimilarly, YapBay can connect small businesses in developing nations who need access to credit with microloan providers in wealthier nations.\n\nA small business owner Jose, in Perú, needs a loan of 1,000 USD to buy advanced farm equipment. Traditional lenders are hesitant due to Jose's location, lack of credit history, lack of a bank account and the questionable state of the land registry in his area.\n\nJack, who lives in New York, wishes to contribute to the economic growth of developing areas and is willing to loan the money to Jose.\n\nIn YapBay, Jack finds an offer from Alex, also in New York, who can take his 1,000 USD and in return, give him an equivalent amount of OP which then gets escrowed.\n\nThen, Jack chains this offer with another offer from Sofia in Lima, Perú who can take the OP and then deliver 1,000 USD worth of Peruvian Soles in cash to Jose.\n\nWith the money received from Sofia, Jose can purchase his equipment and make repayments over time, thus using YapBay to secure funding and circumventing banking barriers.\n\n### Scenario 4: Donation for Social Causes\n\nAlice, based in Sydney, wants to donate 500 AUD to a non-governmental organization (NGO) conducting relief work in rural areas of India. Traditional money transfer services prove to be inefficient, costly, and time-consuming.\n\nFurthermore, she finds that the ONGs operating in Australia either do not offer convincing projects in rural India or have very high overhead costs that detract from the impact of her donation.\n\nShe finds two offers on YapBay to help her.\n\n**Offer 1**: Ben in Sydney can receive Alice's 500 AUD in his Australian bank account and in return, sell Alice 500 AUD worth of ETH, escrowed by Ben.\n\n**Offer 2**: Priya, in India, can receive the 500 AUD worth of ETH and in return, deposit the equivalent INR into the NGO's bank account in India.\n\nYapBay thus breaks down barriers for international donations, making it easier for people worldwide to support the causes near and dear to their hearts.\n\nFurthermore, now donors can donate direct to local NGOs who are closest to the works to be executed, know the local needs better, are more responsive to local needs and have much lower overhead costs than the large international NGOs.\n\n### Scenario 5: Crisis Management During Forced Migration\n\nDuring a socio-political crisis, SafeHaven - a fictional non-profit organization based in Italy, is working to support refugees from the affected area. SafeHaven usually uses traditional channels to send money, which aren't functioning because of the shutdown of banks in the crisis area.\n\nHowever, with YapBay, SafeHaven finds a more feasible solution.\n\n**Offer 1**: Carlo in Italy, can receive the financial support fund from SafeHaven in his Italian account and in return, give SafeHaven an equivalent amount of EURC, which is then escrowed.\n\n**Offer 2**: Mustafa, a businessman who manages to operate in the crisis-hit region, can receive the escrowed EURC from Carlo and in return, distribute local currency, or goods as needed, to refugees in the region.\n\nThis way, YapBay helps mitigate the impacts of crisis situations, ensuring essential funds reach where they need to go safely and quickly, even when the banks or other local infrastructure are not working.\n\n### Scenario 6: Accessing Mobile Money in Africa\n\nGeorge in Kenya is trying to pay for vital medical treatment for his father but finds it impossible with his limited access to banks. His friend Lucy, based in New York, offers to help.\n\nShe uses YapBay to make a remittance through mobile money, which is popular and widely used in many parts of Africa.\n\n**Offer 1**: On YapBay, Lucy finds Daniel, a fellow New Yorker who can take her 200 USD and in return offer 200 USDC.\n\n**Offer 2**: She then links to an offer by James in Kenya who can receive the 200 USDC and in turn deposit 20,000 Kenyan shillings (around 200 USD) into George's mobile money account.\n\nThus, YapBay allows for remittances using popular local payment methods in regions with limited banking infrastructure.\n\n### Scenario 7: Circumventing Capital Controls\n\nAnastasia in Greece wishes to move 1,000 EUR to her college-attending son, Dimitri in Germany. However, due to recently imposed capital controls, she is unable to do so through her bank.\n\nShe turns to YapBay to construct two chained offers.\n\n**Offer 1**: Luke, a Greek resident unaffected by the restrictions, is willing to accept her 1,000 EUR (perhaps in cash) and in return offer her 1,000 EURC.\n\n**Offer 2**: Helmut in Germany will receive the 1,000 EURC and deposit 1,000 EUR into Dimitri's German bank account.\n\nWith YapBay, Anastasia can navigate around capital controls and make sure her son has access to funds for college.\n\n### Scenario 8: Overcoming Limitations on Bank Withdrawals\n\nAfter experiencing an economic crash, the government of Argentina has set a limit on bank withdrawals. Juan, a shopkeeper there, needs more funds than allowed to keep his business afloat.\n\nHis cousin Maria in Spain wants to help him with 2,000 EUR.\n\nMaria finds two linked offers on YapBay.\n\n**Offer 1**: Natalia in Spain can receive Maria's 2,000 EUR and offer her an equivalent escrowed USDC.\n\n**Offer 2**: Pedro in Argentina will accept the escrowed 2,000 EUR in USDC and distribute an equivalent in Argentine Pesos to Juan's bank account (or in cash, or in a foreign bank account that Juan can access), bypassing the withdrawal limit.\n\nBy using YapBay, Juan can keep his business running despite harsh economic conditions.\n\n## Sequential Escrow\n\nEscrow systems have long facilitated transactions between parties by adding trust to the process.\n\nSequential escrow is what I am calling it when there are two or more chained P2P offers and, in order to accelerate the transaction, the output of the first trade is immediately and automatically escrowed in the next trade in the sequence.\n\nInstead of isolating each transaction, sequential escrow facilitates a seamless, chain-like movement of funds from one trade to the next.\n\nThis system creates a trustless environment as each party is assured that their transaction is secured and they will receive their funds once they fulfill their part of the deal. This creates a natural order of operations that protects all members of the chain from potential fraud.\n\nTo better illustrate the acceleration brought by sequential escrow, let's revisit some of the scenarios touched on earlier:\n\n### Scenario Revisited: Simple Remittance\n\nConsider Larry and Maria's transaction. Without sequential escrow, after Larry receives his 50 USDC from Mike in Offer 1, he would have to initiate a new transaction with Andres for Offer 2. This entails creating a new escrow, which adds additional steps and time to the process.\n\nWith sequential escrow, however, the transfer of escrow from Mike to Andres occurs instantaneously and automatically as Larry's fiat payment is verified. This eliminates the downtime between transactions, expediting the remittance process significantly.\n\n### Scenario Revisited: Global Freelance Payment\n\nIn the case of Nina and Mr. Smith, sequential escrow particularly shines due to the multiple borders crossed. Without sequential escrow, Mr. Smith's payment, despite being in cryptocurrency, could still face delays as each transaction would have to be cleared before the subsequent one commences.\n\nHowever, with sequential escrow the transition from Paul's transaction to Grace's is near-instantaneous. The automation and linkage between Offer 1 and Offer 2 expedite the completion of these transactions, enabling Nina to receive her payment swiftly, and allowing Mr. Smith to avoid exorbitant foreign transaction fees and processing times.\n\nThese scenarios demonstrate how sequential escrow significantly trims processing times by chaining transactions together, adding a layer of efficiency that streamlines the remittance process. In doing so, it serves as another testament to YapBay's commitment towards continuous innovation in the remittance ecosystem.\n\n### RAI\n\nRAI is a wizard that aims to leverage AI to make the construction of multi-step remittance transactions as simple and efficient as possible for unsophisticated remittance senders.\n\nThis is a unique value offering that aims to make the complex simple and straightforward.\n\nRAI will guide users through the process of connecting distinct offers to accomplish a seamless currency transition from one country to another using crypto as the transport layer.\n\nRAI asks end-users their source (starting currency) and their destination (ending) currency. Leveraging a pathfinding algorithm, RAI optimally identifies the most efficient path(s) to convert the starting asset into the final one.\n\nThe Wizard achieves this by breaking down each step, detailing necessary per offer exchange rates and providing total fees (including those from the network and offers) required for the exchange. It displays the \"amount-in and amount-out\"–making it easier for users to understand the conversion rates and the potential value received.\n\nRAI aims to revolutionizes the way individuals transact cross-border remittances by providing a seamless, reliable, and efficient medium to interchange cross-border fiat.\n\nRAI represent a benchmark in disrupting an industry worth billions by introducing transparency, cutting back inefficiencies, and promoting more equitable access to global financial services.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy innovating a sequential escrow system, YapBay is dramatically speeding up fiat-to-fiat remittances, and via the Remittance Acceleration Interface (RAI), it is simplifying the complexity of multi-step remittance transactions.\n\nThe various use scenarios discussed here serve as a testament to the flexibility and wide-ranging applicability of YapBay's system. From circumventing capital controls to facilitating global freelance payments, YapBay's unique solution has a broad spectrum of use cases. It is demonstrating its potential to democratize access to speedy and efficient money and asset transfers worldwide.\n\nIn the near future, as YapBay continues to evolve and becomes even more decentralized, those who have been underserved by TraFi will have an opportunity to engage with a platform that is tailor-made for their needs.\n\nThe promise of YapBay lies not just in the immediate improvements it offers to remittance transactions, but in how these improvements will shape impactful and lasting changes in the financial landscape, particularly in the developing world.","src/content/blog/yapbay-uvp.md","5ce2b8ae6919a60f",{"html":108,"metadata":109},"\u003Cp>What makes YapBay different from a LocalBitcoins, LocalCryptos or Paxful, you might ask?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What a great question!\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"yapbays-new-features\">YapBay’s New Features\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>YapBay is a next iteration of these platforms and brings the following new features to a global audience hungry for remittances:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Fiat-to-Fiat Remittances\u003C/strong>: chained P2P transactions where users can move fiat currency in one country to another using crypto as the transport layer.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Sequential Escrow\u003C/strong>: simplified transferral of escrowed crypto from one transaction to the next to expedite cross-border fiat-to-fiat remittances.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>RAI\u003C/strong>: The Remittance Acceleration Interface (RAI) is a wizard that aims to leverage AI to make the construction of multi-step remittance transactions as simple and efficient as possible for unsophisticated remittance senders.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>Additionally, YapBay is:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Web3\u003C/strong>: YapBay is censorship-resistant, and will become more decentralized over time.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>DAO\u003C/strong>: YapBay will eventually become a self-governning DAO, run by its traders.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>No KYC or AML\u003C/strong>: There will be no protocol-level KYC or AML requirements; individual traders will make their own decisions and the dapp can integrate tools to help them.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Open Source\u003C/strong>: YapBay is committed to being open source from day 1.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"scenarios\">Scenarios\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>When thinking about new products, I find scenarios can sometimes help understand the value proposition.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"scenario-1-simple-remittance\">Scenario 1: Simple Remittance\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Larry has 5,000 USD in a bank account in Miami.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Maria has a very small amount of COP in a bank account in Medellín.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Larry wants to send Maria 50 USD so she can buy groceries.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, they do not want to use Western Union or any other legacy/TradFi remittance provider as it is slow, prone to delays, requires lots of paperwork, etc.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So Larry comes to YapBay and he finds a 2 offers to help him get the money to Maria.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He uses the RAI wizard to build his transaction by chaining together the 2 offers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Offer 1\u003C/strong>: Mike is based in the US.

SafeHaven usually uses traditional channels to send money, which aren’t functioning because of the shutdown of banks in the crisis area.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, with YapBay, SafeHaven finds a more feasible solution.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Offer 1\u003C/strong>: Carlo in Italy, can receive the financial support fund from SafeHaven in his Italian account and in return, give SafeHaven an equivalent amount of EURC, which is then escrowed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Offer 2\u003C/strong>: Mustafa, a businessman who manages to operate in the crisis-hit region, can receive the escrowed EURC from Carlo and in return, distribute local currency, or goods as needed, to refugees in the region.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This way, YapBay helps mitigate the impacts of crisis situations, ensuring essential funds reach where they need to go safely and quickly, even when the banks or other local infrastructure are not working.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"scenario-6-accessing-mobile-money-in-africa\">Scenario 6: Accessing Mobile Money in Africa\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>George in Kenya is trying to pay for vital medical treatment for his father but finds it impossible with his limited access to banks. His friend Lucy, based in New York, offers to help.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>She uses YapBay to make a remittance through mobile money, which is popular and widely used in many parts of Africa.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Offer 1\u003C/strong>: On YapBay, Lucy finds Daniel, a fellow New Yorker who can take her 200 USD and in return offer 200 USDC.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Offer 2\u003C/strong>: She then links to an offer by James in Kenya who can receive the 200 USDC and in turn deposit 20,000 Kenyan shillings (around 200 USD) into George’s mobile money account.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thus, YapBay allows for remittances using popular local payment methods in regions with limited banking infrastructure.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"scenario-7-circumventing-capital-controls\">Scenario 7: Circumventing Capital Controls\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Anastasia in Greece wishes to move 1,000 EUR to her college-attending son, Dimitri in Germany.

Juan, a shopkeeper there, needs more funds than allowed to keep his business afloat.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>His cousin Maria in Spain wants to help him with 2,000 EUR.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Maria finds two linked offers on YapBay.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Offer 1\u003C/strong>: Natalia in Spain can receive Maria’s 2,000 EUR and offer her an equivalent escrowed USDC.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Offer 2\u003C/strong>: Pedro in Argentina will accept the escrowed 2,000 EUR in USDC and distribute an equivalent in Argentine Pesos to Juan’s bank account (or in cash, or in a foreign bank account that Juan can access), bypassing the withdrawal limit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>By using YapBay, Juan can keep his business running despite harsh economic conditions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"sequential-escrow\">Sequential Escrow\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Escrow systems have long facilitated transactions between parties by adding trust to the process.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sequential escrow is what I am calling it when there are two or more chained P2P offers and, in order to accelerate the transaction, the output of the first trade is immediately and automatically escrowed in the next trade in the sequence.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Instead of isolating each transaction, sequential escrow facilitates a seamless, chain-like movement of funds from one trade to the next.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This system creates a trustless environment as each party is assured that their transaction is secured and they will receive their funds once they fulfill their part of the deal. This creates a natural order of operations that protects all members of the chain from potential fraud.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To better illustrate the acceleration brought by sequential escrow, let’s revisit some of the scenarios touched on earlier:\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"scenario-revisited-simple-remittance\">Scenario Revisited: Simple Remittance\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Consider Larry and Maria’s transaction. Without sequential escrow, after Larry receives his 50 USDC from Mike in Offer 1, he would have to initiate a new transaction with Andres for Offer 2. This entails creating a new escrow, which adds additional steps and time to the process.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>With sequential escrow, however, the transfer of escrow from Mike to Andres occurs instantaneously and automatically as Larry’s fiat payment is verified. This eliminates the downtime between transactions, expediting the remittance process significantly.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"scenario-revisited-global-freelance-payment\">Scenario Revisited: Global Freelance Payment\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>In the case of Nina and Mr. Smith, sequential escrow particularly shines due to the multiple borders crossed. Without sequential escrow, Mr. Smith’s payment, despite being in cryptocurrency, could still face delays as each transaction would have to be cleared before the subsequent one commences.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, with sequential escrow the transition from Paul’s transaction to Grace’s is near-instantaneous. The automation and linkage between Offer 1 and Offer 2 expedite the completion of these transactions, enabling Nina to receive her payment swiftly, and allowing Mr. Smith to avoid exorbitant foreign transaction fees and processing times.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>These scenarios demonstrate how sequential escrow significantly trims processing times by chaining transactions together, adding a layer of efficiency that streamlines the remittance process. In doing so, it serves as another testament to YapBay’s commitment towards continuous innovation in the remittance ecosystem.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"rai\">RAI\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>RAI is a wizard that aims to leverage AI to make the construction of multi-step remittance transactions as simple and efficient as possible for unsophisticated remittance senders.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is a unique value offering that aims to make the complex simple and straightforward.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>RAI will guide users through the process of connecting distinct offers to accomplish a seamless currency transition from one country to another using crypto as the transport layer.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>RAI asks end-users their source (starting currency) and their destination (ending) currency. Leveraging a pathfinding algorithm, RAI optimally identifies the most efficient path(s) to convert the starting asset into the final one.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Wizard achieves this by breaking down each step, detailing necessary per offer exchange rates and providing total fees (including those from the network and offers) required for the exchange.
